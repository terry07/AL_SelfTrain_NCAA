# Combining Active Learning with Self-training Scheme

This repository has been created for providing an implementation of an _AL+SSL_ framework that aims at alleviating the human effort during the learning stage from unlabeled data inserting an additional stage for reducing noisy decisions. It also accompanies the article with title **Classification of acoustical signals
by combining Active Learning strategies with Semi-supervised Learning schemes**  which has been submitted to [NCAA](https://link.springer.com/journal/521) journal. As it concerns the specific strategies of AL and SSL concepts that are employed, it combines Uncertainty Sampling Query Strategy along with Self-training schemes so as to obtain both effective and efficinet approaches. Eight different learners were examined into the proposed framework tackling with problems that stem from acoustical signals. 

Moreover, this work constitutes an extended version of the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900724) published in [IISA2019](http://iisa2019.upatras.gr/) conference.  

After the final decision of journal's reviewers, more insights are going to be provided regarding the examined datasets, the parameters of the proposed scheme and the use of the included tools/scripts for testing or expanding further our work.

The rest of authors who contributed to this repository are Chris Aridas, Dr. Vasileios G. Kanas, and our supervisor Dr. Sotiris Kotsiantis.
