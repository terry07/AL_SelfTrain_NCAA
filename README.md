# Combining Active Learning with Self-training Scheme
This Github has been created for providing an implementation of an _AL+SSL_ variant, which has been submitted to [NCAA](https://link.springer.com/journal/521) journal, combining Uncertainty Sampling Query Strategy along with Self-training schemes so as to obtain both effective and efficinet approaches. Eight different learners were examined into the proposed framework tackling with problems that stem from acoustical signals. 

Moreover, this work constitutes an extended version of the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900724) published in [IISA2019](http://iisa2019.upatras.gr/) conference.  

The rest of authors who contributed to this repository are Chris Aridas, Dr. Vasileios G. Kanas, and our supervisor Dr. Sotiris Kotsiantis.
